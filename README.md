# Projects-in-Image-Processing

Hi, I'm Mark Sheinberg, a passionate developer with a strong interest in computer vision and image processing.
During my learning journey, I built several practical projects in image processing, focusing on understanding both theory and implementation from scratch, without relying solely on ready-made solutions.

These projects explore core techniques like noise reduction, edge detection, histogram manipulation, frequency domain filtering, and segmentation — providing a foundation for real-world applications in computer vision.

This repository contains some of the main projects I developed.

📚 List of Projects
1. Noise Reduction
Goal: Improve image quality by removing different types of noise (salt & pepper, Gaussian noise).

Techniques: Median filter, Gaussian filter.

Highlights:

Implemented custom filtering functions.

Compared noise reduction results quantitatively and visually.

2. Edge Detection
Goal: Identify object boundaries within images.

Techniques: Sobel operator, Prewitt operator, Canny edge detector.

Highlights:

Built edge detectors manually (convolutions) and compared their accuracy.

Tuned Canny detector thresholds to optimize performance.

3. Histogram Equalization
Goal: Enhance contrast in low-light or low-dynamic-range images.

Techniques: Histogram stretching and equalization (both manually and using OpenCV).

Highlights:

Implemented histograms and cumulative distribution functions manually.

Visualized histograms before and after enhancement.


Techniques: 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Gaussian low-pass and high-pass filters.

Highlights:

Visualized amplitude and phase spectrums.

Designed custom frequency filters for specific tasks (e.g., deblurring).
